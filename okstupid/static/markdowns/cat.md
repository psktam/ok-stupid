## How He Came Into My Life
It was an overcast April day in Merritt Island, Florida. The year was 
2020, and I had just moved there for work and therefore didn't really
know anybody at the time. With the pandemic in full swing, that 
reality was unlikely to change. Suffice it to say that I was 
bored and lonely.

The house I lived in at the time had a rather large backyard, and 
the neighborhood cats liked to come and play there from time to 
time. The concept of cats just coming and going is a little magical
to me. Where are they from? Where do they go at night? Why did they 
decide to come here, and what do they get up to during the day? It's
like that scene from Fantastic Mr. Fox where they see the wolf off 
in the distance. I decided I'd try to make my life a little bit more
magical by feeding them and thus hopefully befriending them.

Then Freddie showed up. I was sitting out in the back patio when I saw 
him picking his way across my backyard, so I opened the door and 
beckoned him to take some treats from me. At first, he was a little 
wary, but quickly gained courage at the sight of food and began nibbling
away at my offering as I sat some distance away just watching him.
Then, he completely surprised me by just walking right up to me and 
climbing into my lap without so much as a "how-do-you-do?". Immediately,
he began purring, kneading my legs with his sharp, sharp claws, rubbing 
his face into my glasses, and drooling all over me. 

To be honest, I was a little shocked, and a little nervous. **Never** 
in my life have I ever seen a cat go from maybe a little standoffish 
and shy to immediately lovey-dovey like that. Since his claws and 
teeth were near my face, I didn't want to make any sudden moves for 
fear of triggering a whirlwind of sharp pointy things and just let
him keep doing things. In short order, I was covered with cat hair
and drool, and since I was also slightly allergic to cats at the 
time, my sinuses were absolutely inflamed. But I didn't care. Cats
indeed are magical creatures, masters of bewitching and enthrallment.
From that very moment, he had captured my soul, though I feebly 
tried to resist for a little bit.

Eventually, I had to stop our little love-session because it was
seriously getting difficult to for me to breathe. I let him back out 
into the backyard, then immediately went to the local Target to 
get some kitty litter and some cat food. My reasoning being that if
he ever wanted to show back up one day and stay the night, I'd at
least be prepared for him. When I got back, he wasn't around 
anymore, which made me a little sad, but not too much, since I had
hope that I'd see him again someday. As I mentioned earlier, it 
was an overcast day, and by that evening, the clouds had gotten
thicker, and it was pretty obvious that it was going to start 
raining soon. I was playing a video game, I don't remember which 
one, when very faintly, I thought I heard something a little 
unusual. I stopped playing and listened more intently, and there 
it was again: a soft, little meow. Then another one, and then
another one. They were coming from my _front_ door this time. 
I hadn't shown him my front door, and yet somehow he not only 
knew this was the same house he had visited earlier that day, but
that he could gain entry this way as well. The sight of him 
just sitting out front with the rain falling around him, meowing
to be let in nearly shattered my heart.

He spent that night with me in the living room, and that was 
pretty rough. Like I said, I was somewhat allergic to cats that
time. It's the kind of allergy that eventually gets better the
more you expose yourself to what triggers it, but that night I 
had gone from 0% cat exposure to 100% cat exposure, and I was
struggling. My sinuses felt like someone had shoved two 
bath stoppers up my nostrils, and now my asthma was kicking in,
making it hard to breathe through my mouth. And on top of
that, Freddie insisted on sleeping on top of me, purring and
slow-blinking at me while I struggled to maintain life. 
Writing about it now, I realize that I'd do it all over again.

The next morning, I let him back out again, thinking that he 
might be just a neighborhood stray or someone else's pet that 
had gotten lost and just happened to show up at my door, but
he came back again that evening. He didn't have any tags or a
microchip, and after putting up some facebook posts to look 
for his owner turned up nothing, he's stayed with me since. 
I was going to say that I decided to keep him, but I realized
that as I was typing that out, I really had no agency in the
matter. It was all according to his plans.

Though I named him Mr. Rogers when I first got him, saying
"Mr. Rogers" all the time ended up being a bit of a mouthful
each time. My sibling started calling him Freddie, and that 
name has since stuck, along with a million other mutations 
of that name.
