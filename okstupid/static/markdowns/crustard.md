# Crustard
I stumbled across this little fellow on the 
[r/oneorangebraincell](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneorangebraincell) subreddit.
Poor little guy apparently suffered a traumatic eye injury, which somehow led 
him to developing cancer in the injured eye. Thankfully, it seemed to be caught
somewhat early on before it metastasized elsewhere. It ended up with him 
getting his eye removed, however. That, in addition to the lion cut that these 
fluffy cats tend to get, along with his preferred sitting position, makes me
crack up every time I see him so I thought I'd take some images and save them 
here.
