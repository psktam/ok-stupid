# Selkirk
This happened either on or during the No Kings Day protests that occurred on 
Saturday, June 14, 2025. There was a pride parade in Spokane, WA that appeared
to be well-attended and already rather festive. Then the Spokane Fire Department
brought along their station cat, named Selkirk, who blessed the teeming masses 
with the sight of his majestic visage for a few seconds.

In the video you can see for yourself what an effect such benificence had upon
the adoring supplicants.
