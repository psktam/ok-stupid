# 2003 Subaru Baja EV Conversion
I am trying to turn my 2003 Subaru Baja into an EV. 
The world of DIY EV-conversion is a lot more advanced than I
originally imagined it was. 

## The Plan
My Baja has the base, non-turbo engine paired to a 5-speed
manual transmission. That spec gives it a curb weight of 
3,460 pounds.

At the end of the day, when I'm done with this car, I 
decided to give myself the following requirements.

### 1. Range on a full charge
A full charge should allow me to drive to and from any 
errand I'll need to run within the city. To try to figure 
out what a good number for desired range ought to be, I 
took a look at google maps and picked out the furthest 
interesting thing I could find from my house that still 
looked like it was somewhat within Austin city limits,
which for me ended up being the 
[Ladybird Johnson Wildflower Center](https://www.wildflower.org)
which, now that I look at it, I feel like I _have_ to go 
visit now.
That's about a 25 mile drive away from where I live, so
a 50 mile round-trip. Therefore, I'm going to aim for
a full-battery range of **75 miles**.

The fuel tank on the Baja is around 17 gallons or so, and 
the EPA combined fuel efficiency rating for my particular
configuration is approximately 20MPG. That jives with my 
personal experience with the car, though maybe a bit on 
the high side for me.

### 2. Acceleration
One major complaint I have about my naturally-aspirated
engine is that it's just extremely underpowered and 
just cannot move my car very well from a dead stop. It
does not develop any useful torque until around 3000 RPM, 
and takes forever to get there.

In the torque band, the throttle feels responsive enough,
so I don't really care to increase my peak power or 
torque figures. All I really want is a powerplant that has
a flatter torque and power curve, so that's how I decided 
to size my motor. In the end, I decided to go with the

Looking at the power and torque curves for this motor, 
I'm already liking the torque band a lot more. I have a
lot of grunt down low, which is where I need it most, 
and the peak torque number itself is also higher, at 
220.7Nm, compared to the 170-ish Nm the 
engine can produce. It looks to be enough to be snappy
and responsive, but not so much to the point where I'd 
burn rubber if I floored the accelerator (I really 
hope not).
