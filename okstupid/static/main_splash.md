# Hello
<img src="static/profile.jpg" width="400"/>

My name is Peter Kim. I live in Austin with my cat, Mr. Rogers,
though I typically just call him Freddie. He's a dusty orange-
colored domestic shorthair who showed up in my back patio one
day while I was living Florida, back in 2020. 

I'm a software engineer at 
[chess.com](https://www.chess.com), the world's #1 chess 
website, although I suck at chess. If you play chess, feel
free to friend me 
[here](https://www.chess.com/member/the_blunderbus).
