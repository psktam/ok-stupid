I can't believe it's been over a month since I last wrote an entry here. Lotsa
shit's been happening. 

But since the last time I posted, the major development since then is that 
I've been able to pull the engine out of the engine bay. It ended up being
a much less eventful affair than I was afraid that it would be, though it still
required some grunting and straining, along with the help of a good friend of
mine who was willing to endure peak Austin heat and the filth of my garage to 
help me take this out.

The engine in my 2003 baja is an EJ25 mated to the MT5 manual transmission. 
There are a lot of videos on the internet that walk through the process of 
pulling the engine, so I won't spend a ton of time recounting every agonizing
detail here. Some points and parameters that might be relevant to others 
wanting to do this for themselves in the future, however, are:

- There's no need to drain the power-steering system or purge the A/C system 
  like the factory service manual would suggest that you do. You can just
  detach the power-steering pump and the A/C compressor from the engine block
  and leave them on the side of the engine bay while you pull out the rest of 
  the engine.
- In addition to detaching all the coolant lines for the radiator and the 
  heater core, it's highly recommended to remove the radiator at the front as
  well so that you can buy yourself some more room to maneuver the engine 
  block while you're pulling it out
- MAKE SURE YOU HAVE ENOUGH VERTICAL CLEARANCE IF YOU'RE WORKING ON THIS IN 
  THE GARAGE. I almost got into a pickle because the engine hoist I was using
  was starting to crash into the ceiling as I jacked it up to crane the engine 
  out. I was only able to get out of it by lowering the car past the first 
  safety stop on the lift in order to buy myself more clearance between the
  underside of the engine and the car. While I don't think this was a dangerous
  thing to do, it was something that I should have thought about and planned 
  for ahead of time, especially since it was a little hectic trying to deal
  with this in real-time with a 300-lb chunk of metal floating in the air.

I was fortunate enough to find a digital copy of the 
[Subaru factory service manual](/static/subaru_baja_2003_fsm_v4.pdf) 
on the internet, which I used for the engine removal.

Anyways, here are some photos of the aftermath:

As you might be able to tell from the above image, my engine bay is _greasy_. 
Hopefully yours shouldn't look like that; the reason mine looks like that is 
because my power-steering pump has been leaking for a while, and it's been
spewing the oil all over the engine bay, resulting in the lovely grime you see
above. Now that I have more access to things, I should be able to tinker with
this and fix it up a bit so I don't have to keep topping off the power-steering
reservoir every few months.

I will admit, I puff my chest up a little bit and strut whenever I see the 
engine sitting on the floor, but it _is_ taking up quite a bit of space in my
garage. I'm going to need to find someone to buy this or take it off of my hands
soon X-D.
