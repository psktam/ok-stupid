I've been spending the past few days putting together the battery boxes for the
Baja. It's taken me a _lot_ longer of a time to put these things together 
because designing and building them turned out to be waaay more complicated than
I thought they'd be. I had to think pretty hard about a lot of things before I 
pulled the trigger on actually buying materials and building these things.

It might help to start with explaining how I want to mount these things in the 
first place. To try to preserve the original weight and balance of the car, I 
planned on mounting 3 in the back on the underside of the car, and 3 in the 
back where the engine currently is.

        front end a lot while working on this so far.

The 3 in back would be subject to puddle splashes and kickback from loose rocks 
and grovel, not to mention a heck a lot of bouncing and vibrations from the
normal course of driving and being mounted so close to the suspesion. Yet, I'm 
not working with a lot of space, the batteries are _heavy_, and I need to be 
very careful that if I decide I want to build the battery boxes out of metal,
that I provide plenty of safety against the battery terminals accidentally 
shorting themselves against the walls of their enclosures and setting fire to
my house.

As of now, I've (mostly) finished designing the box that will hold 2 battery 
modules and have started building it. You can see the design 
[here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/619a24ff1b98c29cf85a7039/w/36708c5facd4ad3c7133e284/e/205a2a75c9ad0c43916a7d6f?renderMode=0&uiState=682ac5b38cd8375189cf9fdd), 
or if you don't have an OnShape account, it looks like this:

There's nothing very special about this, but I can talk about some technical 
details about it that might be helpful for anyone else who'd want to build 
their own battery boxes, because buying custom-made ones from elsewhere can 
easily run thousands of dollars.

## Overall Materials
The box itself is essentially a frame built out of 1/2" square steel tubing, and
paneled with sheets of 16 gauge sheet metal; everything is made of mild steel. 
The diagram below shows just the framing, as well as where the batteries are
intended to sit:

## Battery Mounting
The diagram above shows that the batteries will be arranged one on top of the
other, but from scrounging random internet forums, it appears that they're 
designed to be fully supported from the little garolite "ears" that protrude 
out of the sides of each module (highlighted below):

<figure>
    <img src="/static/battery_module_ears.png"/>
    <figcaption>

        on the other side of the module, not visible in this photo
    </figcaption>
</figure>

Additionally, when these modules are installed in Tesla cars, they're designed
to have just a little bit of clearance above and below them, so these ears are
also designed to fully absorb road vibrations and any up-and-down impact loading
may occur from regular driving.

I don't know what the ramifications are of directly stacking these modules on 
top of each other, but I figured why take the risk and designed the boxes to 
also allow the modules to be mounted with a little bit of clearance above and 
below them.

        below each module.

Finally, in order to lock the modules to their mounting rails, the ears on each
module have holes/slots cut out in them for fasteners to go through, so I just
drilled matching holes in their mounting railes to accommodate a bolt/nut 
combination. I drilled out my holes to accommodate 10-32 x 3/4" bolts, and I 
found [these nice, low-profile weld nuts](https://www.mcmaster.com/98001A125/) 
from mcmaster to fasten them on the other side. Because of the limited amount 
of working room, I opted to avoid using any washers at all and bought a bunch of 
flanged bolts.

## Coolant Distribution
Each battery module also has a pair of hose barbs on the backside that allow 
coolant to flow through the pack. Each module needs to be hooked up directly to
the coolant supply and return. I wanted to keep things "neat" and only need a 
single pair of connections to hook up both modules to the coolant supply/return
lines that will be running through the car. This ended up taking me a _long_ 
time to design out because I was really worried about the following things:

- The boxes were designed to be watertight. If any internal leak sprung up, that
  would cause coolant to start pooling up inside and submerge the cells. To 
  mitigate this, I would want to reduce the number of connections that would 
  need to be made inside the box.
- All metal fittings and components in a coolant loop need to be made of the 
  same material in order to avoid galvanic corrosion. Since I'm using Tesla 
  battery modules, that meant _all_ metal components needed to be made of 
  aluminum.

Ultimately, that led to me going with this following design:

Water enters the box through an aluminum distribution manifold that has one 
inlet and 2 outlets, one for each module inside the box. A separate
manifold collects hot outflow from each module and combines them into a single
output that will connect to the main return line.

The manifold itself is just made out of a section of 1.5" x 1.5" aluminum 
with passages drilled throughout it. For the main inlet/outlet fittings, I 
used [this part from mcmaster](https://www.mcmaster.com/2227K13/), and for
the manifold-to-module fittings, I used 
[these parts](https://www.mcmaster.com/5058K768/), which happily come in red
and blue varieties.

## Electrical
Each battery box will need connections for the high-voltage and low-voltage
circuits. There's a shop in Austin called 
[Flash Drive Motors](https://flashdrivemotors.com) that specializes in EV 
conversions, and they tend to use these 
[Amphenol sur-lok](https://www.amphenol-industrial.de/en/products/xev-connectors/surlok) 
connectors to make the high-voltage connections with. The page I linked should
contain a link to their product brochure as well, but just in case, I've 
decided to serve it on my site [here](/static/pdfs/surlok-product-brochure.pdf) 
as well just in case that link goes dead. It contains information on how to 
assembly part numbers for yourself in case if you need to order connectors 
to-spec. For reference, these are the parts I ended up using:

- For the panel mount connectors: SLPIRCBPSO0
- For the cable connectors: SLPPC85BSO0

For the low-voltage connections, it took me a while before I stumbled upon the
Deutsch connector system. I remember when I used to work on the octagrabber, 
these were pretty much the only electrical connections that could stand up to 
the beating we subjected them to in the North Atlantic. Everything else would
rot away or become so extremely bound up with corrosion, but these little fellas
always looked like brand new with just a little bit of dielectric grease.

You can buy these off of Amazon, but fuck Jeff Bezos, and I'm a proud man. I can
find my _own_ parts, thank you very much. Note that if you've never bought
Deutsch connectors before, if you're buying them off of Mouser, you will most 
likely need to buy every part of the connector **system**. That is, not only 
do you need to buy the connector housings themselves, you also need to buy the 
individual pins that go inside the connector, sized for the wires that you 
intend to use, as well as the retaining feature that keeps the pins secured 
inside the connectors. Deutsch's trade name for these parts are called 
"Wedgelocks". I ended up ordering these from Mouser, and in the end, this is
what my parts list ended up looking like:

- Receptacle housing for the box (you need 2x per box): DT04­-4P-­CL03
- Pins for the receptacle for the box (you need 8x per box): 0460-202-1631
- Connector housing for the cable that plugs into the box (you need 2x per box): 
  DT06­-4S-­E008
- Pins for the cable (you need 8x per box): 0462-201-1631 (note, these are 
  actually itty-bitty sockets that the pins on the receptacle slide into, but 
  I'm just calling them "pins")
- "Wedgelock" retaining feature for the Deutsch connector system. You need 4x 
  of these per box, and these go into both the receptacle and cable conectors:
  W4S-­ZZ

You should be able to find all of these parts on mouser.com or Digikey or 
whoever your favorite supplier is. Heck, you might even be able to find these 
at the car store.
