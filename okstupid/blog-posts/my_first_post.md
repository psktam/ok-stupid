I went out to dinner with myself tonight. I went to a place
called Intero's, which is a little down the street from where
the Austin office, where I used to work.

I remember wanting to go there one evening, when I was stuck
there with some coworkers a little late into the night.
We were wondering where we'd go for dinner that night.

I can't remember exactly what we settled on. Maybe it was Cabo 
Bob's? I can't remember that either.

Anyways, it was a pretty hot evening. Typical for Austin at 
this time of year. Cicadas were out in force, yelling their
heads off, looking for love. I ordered a pork chop with roast
zucchini, served on top of a bed of polenta, dotted with blobs
of dill pesto. It was pretty dang good. There were little fatty
bits of pork fat here and there. I had some kind of vodka-based
cocktail there, with like berries in it or something? Is that
what a Cosmopolitan is? It was pretty refreshing, given the
weather. And then to cap it off they gave me a blueberry 
panna cotta. I think Anna would have liked it a lot, though
they don't like mixing flavors, so maybe not.

Afterwards, I decided I'd go for a walk to let the food settle
in my stomach. The pork chop was pretty heavy for that kind of
a night. I was close to what I think is the Westernmost edge of 
Ladybird Lake park, and I strolled a little down the north shore, 
just east of the flood-control gates. There were people fishing
in the river, and I threw some rocks into it because I wanted to 
feel like a delinquent. Lol. So rebellious. ( I didn't throw 
the rocks at the people, to be clear. I threw them into the river
because I realized that it had been a while since I'd thrown rocks
into water ).

On the way back to the car, I saw a young couple engaging in 
some pretty intense PDA out of the corner of my eye. It 
wasn't really explicit, more... cinematic is the word for it?
Like, it looked like that famous photo of thta sailor kissing 
the woman on V-J Day in Times Square. He was lifting her up in 
the air, and she was clasping his head in her hands. If only 
there was a slight wind going it'd have looked like something
out of a Ghibli movie.
